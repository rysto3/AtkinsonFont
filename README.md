# Usage

# What is this?
The Atkinson Hyperlegible font was created by The Braille Institute to provide greater legibility and readability for low vision readers. The font is named after The Braille Institute's founder, J. Robert Atkinson. 

The font focuses on letterform distinction to increase character recognition, ultimately improving readability. 

# Why do you love this font?
My Mom became legally blind as an adult, and seeing the extra effort she has to go through each day in order to read things has made me interested in improving accessibility. 

I wanted to use this font as the primary font on a lot of projects I work on, including my website(s). Rather than self-hosting the font, I wanted to be able to use a service like JSDelivr to make it load as quickly as possible. Hosting it here on GitHub not only allows me to do exactly that, it allows me to further spread the word about this font. 

# How exactly does this font make it easier for people to read it?
This font has unambiguous, distinctive elements and sometimes unexpected forms with the goal of increasing character recognition.
